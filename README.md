# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Blindness-Detection


Recent development in the state of art technology machine learning plays a vital role in the image processing applications such as biomedical, satellite image processing, Artificial Intelligence such as object identification and recognition and so on. Globally, diabetic retinopathy suffered patients growing vastly and the fact is, the earliest stage could not diagnose normal eye vision. Increasing necessity of finding a diabetic retinopathy as earliest would stop vision loss for prolonged diabetes patients although they suffered it young. Severity of the diabetic retinopathy disease is based on the presence of Microaneurysms, Exudates, Neovascularization, Haemorrhages. Experts categorize those diabetic retinopathies into five stages such as Normal, Mild, Moderate, Severe Non Proliferative Retinopathy (NPDR) and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) patients. 
A proposed deep learning approach such as Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) gives high accuracy in classification of these diseases through spatial analysis. A DCNN is more complex architecture inferred more from a human visual perspective. Amongst other supervised algorithms involved, proposed solution is to find a better and optimized way to classify the fundus image with little pre-processing techniques. Our proposed architecture deployed with dropout layer techniques yields higher accuracy. Also, images in the dataset are available publicly.
